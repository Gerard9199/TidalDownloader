You need to use the follow [repositorie](https://github.com/nathom/streamrip/tree/dev)
Also you need to install ffmpeg in your C: directory

Once have done, you will see the songs name are enumerated, for me it is an error.
To solve it, you need to use the first function in the main file.

If you want to use the high quality music (FLAC) in iOS, you must transform the FLAC to ALAC, for this issue you will use the second function.
